Ship Locator
===========

The application is an exercise of using Play2/Scala/ReactiveMongo/AngularJs/Bootstrap/CoffeeScript

Thanks for https://github.com/lashford/modern-web-template for the template

Results: Play2 is monstrous god-like framework which imposes you to use 'non-intrusive' but sloooooooow Sbt. Both play bad with IntelliJ ;(

My advice: use spray.io (it's just a library! no code generation! use any build tool you want!) with maven and IntelliJ (fast!)
